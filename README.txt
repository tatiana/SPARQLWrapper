SPARQL Endpoint interface to Python
-----------------------------------

The distribution contains:

- SPARQLWrapper: the Python library. You should copy the directory 
  somewhere into your PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, you can also run 
  the disutils scrips:

        python setup.py install
  
- script/example.py: a basic example of the library using the public
  end-point of DBpedia.
  
- scripts/sparql.py: to run a SPARQL SELECT query stored in an external 
  file. The URIs for the SPARQL services have to be updated for local 
  use.
